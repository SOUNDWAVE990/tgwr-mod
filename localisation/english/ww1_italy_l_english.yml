ww1_italy.20.t: "The Simplicity, Charm, and Hellenic Beauty of Libya"
ww1_italy.20.d: "Libya has increasingly become of key interest amongst Italian nationalists. Vincenzo Gioberti has written several texts lately speaking on the topic and why it would make for a grand colonial project. Writing on the weather and cities of Libya, Gioberti has painted an image in the readers' heads of warm beaches, flourishing yet humble cities, and endless opportunities. He claims the new colony would be a perfect place for Italians to settle. While this rhetoric is on the fringe right now, it's gaining traction. Some nationalists are indeed calling for a war with the Ottoman Empire, spotting its increasing weakness in the face of Arab nationalism and Balkan rage. For now, though, the idea is seen as a bit ridiculous by most credible Italian politicians."
ww1_italy.20.a: "That certainly sounds nice!"
ww1_italy.22.t: "A Divided Party"
ww1_italy.23.t: "Failed Anti-War Strike"
ww1_italy.23.d: "Several anti-war socialists have attempted to organize national opposition towards a war with Turkey. Some of the more radical individuals against the idea, such as Benito Mussolini, have gone in contact with labour unions across the country to organize a 24-hour shutdown of all activities in order to destroy the rampant pro-war attitdue across Italy. This planned strike ultimately flopped, however, as it recieved little backing from top party officals or the unions, seeing the strike as unnecessary. Such a thing would only worsen the popular opinion of the Socialists, party officials say. Even then, the nationalists call for war against Turkey every year now. What good is a strike if that promised war would never come in the first place?"
ww1_italy.23.a: "Only time will tell."
ww1_italy.19.t: "Italy Surrounded, and the Solution."
ww1_italy.19.d: "Is Italy truly safe on the world stage? We cannot trust neither the French nor the Austrians to respect our national sovereignty with their claims on ethnic Italian land and whatnot. Both have the capability to destroy us, with France being able to wield its navy, blockading any support to Sardinia and Austria being a mere step away from our industrial heartland in the north. The only conclusion that can be sought from this is that Italy needs to grow strong, fast. All parties agree on this matter, the only difference in policy is how they plan to pursue it. The nationalists are increasingly getting the most attention to their plan for a stronger Italy, that being the expansion of our colonial empire into Libya. The territory is controlled by a weak and declining empire, it lies in the middle of the Mediterranean, and is believed to have key resource deposits held within it. With such a conquest Italy could bolster its naval position in the Mediterranean and exploit the resources in Libya to a strong degree - two things which can ensure that Italy's position in the world will not be shaken in the years to come."
ww1_italy.19.a: "Not a bad idea."
ww1_italy.18.t: "La Guerra Lontana"
ww1_italy.21.t: "The Socialist Counter-Reaction"
ww1_italy.21.d: "The increasing public demand for a war to conquer Libya has come as a great suprise to the left. In their eyes, the issue was over with. Settled years ago in the Congress of Berlin. With the issue once again exploding into national prominence, Avanti, the most prominent socialist newspaper in Italy, have began denouncing the idea. It's simply a distraction, another useless war, they argue. To distract from capitalist oppression, and to distract from the true threat of Austrian aggression. A war for Libya would not benefit the average person, only wealthy capitilists who intend to exploit the territory."
ww1_italy.22.d: "...But not all socialists are in agreement. Several socialists have began backing the idea of a war, with some seeing it as Italian liberation of minority being oppresed by the Turks, while others see it as more people to be liberated once the Italian people inevitably elect socialsist to power. Others have even brought the idea of Libya being needed to protect Italy against the likes of France or Austria. No matter the reason, this issue has began to tear a rift amongst socialists in Italy."
ww1_italy.22.a: "They both make convincing arguments"
ww1_italy.21.a: "Don't let them distract you from your real issues!"
ww1_italy.18.d: "The influencial Italian writer Corradini has recently published a new book promoting Italian nationalism and expansionism. In the book, Corradini directly calls for Italian expansionism into Libya, claiming the war would unify the divided and polarized Italian society. His book represents a larger trend amongst Italian nationalists and the Italian population in general: there is a hunger for war with the sick man of europe: The Ottoman Empire. With the Ottomans being so weak, surely Libya would be easy pickings, right?"
ww1_italy.18.a: "La Guerra Vittoriosa!"
 ww1_italy.17.t: "Formation of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana"
 ww1_italy.17.d: "Today, hundreds of journalists, literary figures, and educators gathered in florence to create a new political movement, the ANI. This group has characterized itself as an ultra nationalist and expanionist group who intends to promote the expansion of Italy into various different territories. In particular, the group seems interested in Libya. They see the territory as rightfully Italian, and believe the government should have made an attempt to annex the territory when Austria annexed Bosnia. The group has began publications across Italy to rally people to the cause of Italiah expansionism, and it's having its effect. More and more people are beginning to support colonial wars, with Libya being an especially popular target."\
 ww1_italy.17.a: "They really do have a few points..."
ww1_italy.15.t: "Mantaining Government Stability"
ww1_italy.15.d: "Luzzatti's government fell apart because he did not a base political support from any faction in Italy's parliament, but Giolitti is no novice to Italian politics. Already serving 3 terms as prime minister, he knows how to carefully and strategically align and isolate political factions whenever needed. With his 4th mandate secured, he'll need to keep enough support from MP's in Italy's parliament to ensure his governments survival."
ww1_italy.15.a: "It's what Giolitti does best!"
ww1_italy.14.t: "The Return of Giolitti"
ww1_italy.14.d: "Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same. With Luzzatti's weak leadership failing to consolidate a base of support, and an impending vote of no confidence, Luzzatti has resigned to avoid an embarassing ousting. Who will run the next government? Giolitii, of course. It was always going to be Giolitii. No other Italian politician has nearly as much influence and support as him. With him easily securing the Prime Minister slot, time will tell how his 4th cabinet ends up."
ww1_italy.14.a: "He won't have it easy..."
ww1_italy.13.t: "Breakneck Industrialization"
ww1_italy.13.d: "It is no secret that our status as a great power lies with the north, not the south. The duchies and republics that made Northern Italy their home were able to consolidate and advance to greater heights because of the relative peace. The predecessor to our nation, Sardinia-Piedmont, is such an example.\n\nThe south has, in contrast, laid in a state of disrepair for over a thousand years, exploited by the Arabs, the French, and the Spaniards. It is a shame to say our current policies do much of the same.\n\nAll these pieces of history have shaped the way Italy is today: from the top down. The problem is, the wealth never trickles down, it only flows to the north. It is a price we must bear as a nation, yet only one part does so. Our industrial might shall remain concentrated in Turin, Milan, and the Venetian countryside for as long as this remains. It does not look like it will change anytime soon, but that is just another sad story in the annals of the history of our peninsula."
ww1_italy.13.a: "It's a necessary arrangement"
ww1_italy.9.t: "Universal Suffrage Bill Fails to Pass"
ww1_italy.9.d: "Devestating news has come out of parliament. The vote failed, the law is dead. The laws failure to pass came as several center right legislators flipped against the bill - enough so to stop it from passing."
ww1_italy.9.a: "Unfortunate"
ww1_italy.8.t: "Universal Suffrage Bill Proposed to Parliament "
ww1_italy.8.d: "This is it. A defining moment for Luzzatti's premiership. With the introduction of Universal Suffrage to parliament, we must do whatever we can to get it passed. If we can sucessfully pass it, we can prove to Italians that we are capable of governing sucessfully. It won't be easy, however. The right has put up a unified front against the bill, and they're swaying many centrists. "
ww1_italy.8.a: "Ride or die!"
ww1_italy.7.t: "Death of the Mandate"
ww1_italy.7.d: "With our failure to pass electoral reform, it seems our mandate - and government, are toast. The centrists want Giolitti back, the catholics want a new conservative prime minister, the socialists were never never going to support us, neither were the far right. With pretty much every faction of the government wanting us gone, it's basically inevitable the government will be pushed out by a vote of no confidence soon, unless we resign before then."
ww1_italy.6.t: "Universal Male Suffrage Bill Fails to Pass"
ww1_italy.6.d: "Devestating news has come out of parliament. The vote failed, the law is dead. The laws failure to pass can be mostly blamed on the socialists, who refused to vote for the bill as they saw the bill as not going far enough."
ww1_italy.6.a: "Unfortunate"
ww1_italy.5.t: "Universal Male Suffrage Bill Proposed to Parliament"
ww1_italy.5.d: "This is it. A defining moment for Luzzatti's premiership. With the introduction of Universal Male Suffrage to parliament, we must do whatever we can to get it passed. If we can sucessfully pass it, we can prove to Italians that we are capable of governing sucessfully. It won't be easy, however. There are worries that some on the far left or right may try to rally against the bill. "
ww1_italy.5.a: "Let's hope it passes!"
ww1_italy.1.t: "Giolitti's Support"
ww1_italy.1.d: "Giovanni Giolitti, one of the most influencial Italian politicians who has served as Prime Minister 3 times already, has offered Giolitti lukewarm political support for his agenda. With his massive influence amongst centrist PM's, he'll help us get some of our proposed laws through parliament.\n\nThe problem, however, is that this support is quite conditional. With Luzzatti being noticably more left wing on several issues compared to Giolitti, Giolitti is expecting us to moderate our agenda. If we don't, he won't hesitate to end his support of our government."
ww1_italy.1.a: "We'll need to perfect the balancing act"
ww1_italy.2.t: "Our New "Friends""
ww1_italy.2.d: "Many in the PSI have been... apprehensive to working with centrists. From their eyes, working with moderate liberals to push smaller reforms then they hope for would only help to entrench the centrist domination of Italian politics, as pushing smaller reforms could satisfy parts of the electorate who want change, but not revolutionary change. A lot of the power base of the PSI comes from angry ordinary citizens, and keeping them angry at the system is key for their electoral performance. Thus, it's likely around half of the PSI will oppose our reforms no matter what, unless we capitulate to their demands. Still though, it's hard to argue our recent overtures to the PSI have been useless. We have indeed secured a small base of support from their party to our upcoming agenda."
ww1_italy.2.a: "The radicals are putting politics over the people!"
ww1_italy.3.t: "The Clock Ticks"
ww1_italy.3.d: "Many Italian political analysis are seeing Luzzatti's government as inevitable to fall in due time. After all, the socialists see him as a milquetoast liberal who refuses to bring any real change to the country,catholics don't exactly see him as pushing their interests, ultra nationalists at best see him as weak, and the centrists prefer Giolitti. Luzzatti, they theorize, doesn't have a strong base of support amongst any faction. If he wants his government to avoid a no confidence vote, he's going to have to make new friends."
ww1_italy.3.a: "They have a point"
ww1_italy.4.t: "Our New Friends"
ww1_italy.4.d: "Luzzatti has always leaned slightly to the the left of center, which has caused many in the center right to take a disliking to him. With his government being viewed as being at risk of a no confidence vote, it's clear mending relations with the center right would be the easiest way to avoid it. Thus, Luzzatti has begun making significant overtures to the center right, promising to moderate social rhetoric and give them significant input on his suffrage bill that he plans to introduce to parliament soon. The attempts at mending relations have been met favorably amongst the center right for now, although many of them still favor a new prime minister - someone like Giolitti."
ww1_italy.4.a: "Atleast it's been productive"
ww1_italy.10.t: "Italian Nationalists Call Invasion of Libya!"
ww1_italy.10.d: "Italian nationalists have long wanted to build a colonial empire, however Italy proved to be too weak to secure it's deserved chunk of Africa. The press, however, has began pushing for a war with the Ottomans to secure Libyan, with an earnest response from their readers. They claim Libya is full of natural resources and a population pleading for Italian liberation, being defended by a measly 4 thousand soldiers. Word of mouth proves quite capable too, with whispers being exchanged in parliament about how capturing Libya would be a walk in the park. It would be quite the treat if those whispers proved true, but you can never know until you try."
ww1_italy.10.a: "Rally to the cause!"
ww1_italy.11.t: "A Second Scramble"
ww1_italy.11.d: "It appears as if the Scramble for Africa has not yet concluded. With the French assuming absolute control over the strategic region of Morroco our ambitions on Libya seem not too far fetched after all. While our hopes at an Eastern African empire were dashed at Adwa, North Africa is ripe for the taking from their decadant Turkish masters. The press is drumming up support for a campaign to be conducted within the next few years against the Ottomans. The fervor for empire is on the rise."
ww1_italy.11.a: "War is nigh!"
ww1_italy.12.t: "Framework"
ww1_italy.12.d: "Framework"
ww1_italy.12.a: "Framework"
ww1_italy.12.b: "Framework"
ww1_italy.12.c: "Offer the Italians a protectorate"
ww1_italy.24.t: "Anger Amongst Northern Business Owners"
ww1_italy.24.d: "Northern business elite have always had a sort of quid pro quo relationship with Giolitti. Neither one of them particularly like eachother, but both have a level of self respect. The both also understand working with eachother can have mutual benefits for themselves and the country. However, Giolitti's recent policies of municipal socialism has lead to great anger amongst them. These policies are cutting deeply into their profits and causing business growth to slow down. A few of them have switched towards right wing opposition as a result, which is hurting our political standings."
ww1_italy.24.a: "It's a small fraction of them anyways"
ww1_italy.16.t: "Risk of Radicalization Amongst Workers"
ww1_italy.16.d: "Italy has strong organized unions in the north, and socialists have been making large inroads amongst them in the last few years. As they see their conditions as more and more unacceptable, more and more of them are voting for the PSI. If we want to minimize this, we'll need to ensure that workers conditions are improving, and that we arn't rushing industrialization too fast."
ww1_italy.16.a: "Noted!"
ww1_italy.25.t: "[TUR.GetName] offers us a deal"
ww1_italy.25.d: "make cyrenica and tripolitania"
ww1_italy.25.a: "blah"
ww1_italy.26.t: "italy refuses"
ww1_italy.26.d: "damn"
ww1_italy.26.a: "lol"
ww1_italy.27.t: "On the Unacceptable Compromise"
ww1_italy.27.d: "What is the Italian government doing? This is the question many nationalists writers across the country are asking, in light of the recent news of the compromise with the Ottoman Empire over the Libyan question. While a protectorate won't hurt Italy, Italy could have gotten so much more. A full annexation of Libya, war reperations, hell Albania were all on the table. This sort of weakness from the Italian Government, they argue, is unacceptable. "
ww1_italy.27.a: "They will always find something to complain about!"
ww1_italy.28.t: "Revolutionary Mood Sweeps the Left"
ww1_italy.28.d: "The Italian left has always had its reformist and revolutionary wings, but the revolutionary wing was always the smaller of the 2. Unfortunately, the left has starting becoming more and more radical as of late. They see compromise with liberals as becoming increasingly impossible, and are beginning to favor strikes as a way to bring change instead of bringing change through the ballot box."
ww1_italy.28.a: "Disturbing!"

ww1_italy.32.t: "Radicals Takeover PSI"
ww1_italy.32.d: "The 'Maximalist' faction of the PSI has prevailed at the party convention held last month. Already, the party has started going under dramatic reconstruction. Moderates have been kicked out of the party, with a new moderate socialist party already being formed. Most importantly, and also worryingly, they've denounced cooperation with Giolitti and are encouraging members of the PSI to refuse to work with him. Giolitti's coalition has enjoyed a decent amount of socialist support in the past, and with support from the PSI being pretty much a done deal, Giolitii will have to look towards other coalition partners."

ww1_italy.31.t: "Socialists Distrust Giolitti's Suffrage Reform"
ww1_italy.31.d: "Full male suffrage is one of the key talking points amongst socialists, so you can imagine Giolitti's confusion when he started recieving attacsk from socialists over it. They claim Giolitti must have some sort of alternative motive with the new law. They claim he wants to insult the lower classes by ensuring would not enjoy the prestige and self-fulfillment of electing a government which granted them the right to vote. It's a nonsensical argument, but it's being met with agreement by a suprisingly large amount of socialists. It doesn't make sense. Shouldn't they be greatful?"
ww1_italy.31.a: "Are they mentally ill?"
ww1_italy.30.t: "Relegated to the Attic in Italy"
ww1_italy.30.d: "...These are the words Giolitti used to describe Karl Marx and his ideas. It's created outrage amongst Italian socialists, who have much admiration for the man. While Giolittis standing amongst socialists is shaky, he had enjoyed some support from the more moderate members of the party. This recent gaffe has damaged his support amongst them, however, as the comment was seen as a rejection of socialism as a whole. This combined with his recent overtures to nationalist factions have resulted in him being seen increasingly see him as someone who can't be worked with in good faith."

Besides these basical principals? The socialist movement is deeply divided. It has it's pro war, anti war, pro democracy, anti democracy groups. Some socialists support reformed capitalism while others support a total overhaul of the system. This makes it easier for Giolitti to isolate certain factions of the socialists and manipulate others, but it also means the movement is unpredictable.§!\n\nThe §nLeft§!\nWe can rely on support from §C[?ITA_historical_left_support]§!/§Y[?ITA_historical_left_start]§! of their members in parliament.\n§LThe Left is comprised of centrist and center left Italians.

ww1_italy.29.d: "Giolitti has always been a master of the art of trasformismo. Isolating and allying whatever factions of Italy that make sense for his current ambitions. This game of politics, however, is at least helped by the fact that suffrage in Italy is very limited, with the current voter base generally supporting more moderate, predictable politicians. With expanded suffrage, all of this could be thrown out of the window. A new guard of socialists, nationalists and radicals may take power, and they will be much harder to work with. Clearly, by passing male suffrage in the first place, Giolitti believes he can handle it, but will he really be able to?"
